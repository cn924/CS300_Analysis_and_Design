**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**  

For 6-2 We were doing a runtime analysis on the different data structures we were introduced to in this class.  
For  7-1  We read a csv file into a C++ program and populated a binary search tree and outputted a alphabetically sorted course list with attached prerequisites.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**  

With each data structure there are advantages and disadvantages. Some work better depending on the job to be done.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**   

The best way roadblocks were overcome was by preparing first. Writing out the logic, with flowcharts. pseudocode, and researching the data structure to be used for the particular job at hand.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**   

After being introduced and working with the different typesdata structures. It built confidence in working with these in the future.  
Alos there i sover lap in other languages with these same type of datastructures.  

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?** 

Always writing that is commented , reusable, modular, and easily maintained should be at the forefront of any programmer's design agenda.
