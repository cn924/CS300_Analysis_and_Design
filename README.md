**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

For 6-2 We were doing a runtime analysis on the different data structures we were introduced to in this class.
For  7-1  We read a csv file into a C++ program and populated a binary search tree and outputted a alphabetically sorted course list with attached prerequisites.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
